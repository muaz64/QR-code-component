## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to structure a clean, responsive card layout using Flexbox and custom properties. I also practiced using Google Fonts and applying consistent spacing and typography.

```css
.qr-card {
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 1rem;
  box-shadow: 0 20px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
}
```
### Continued development

I want to continue improving my CSS layout skills, especially with Grid and responsive design techniques. I also plan to explore accessibility best practices.
